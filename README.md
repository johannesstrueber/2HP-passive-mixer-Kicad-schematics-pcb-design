# 2HP passive mixer Eurorack Module<br/> Work in Progress Schematics, PCBs, and Design Files 
This consits of very basic schematics and two pcb files. One for the frontpanel and the other for soldering the audio jacks. I also created two design files. The first is for matching the drill holes of the panel with the placed components. The second is for labeling the components on the silkscreen layer of the panel.

***This is a work-in-progress project. Take nothing for granted. The first revision is now ordered***
